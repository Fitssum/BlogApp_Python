# BlogApp_Python

This is a Phyton Blog App built with web2py. What makes web2py different from other Phyton framework is the fact that it is more compact and has more functionality (more supported databases, ticketing system, multiple login methods, role based access control, web based translation interface, support for multiple database connections, and more).

This BlogApp is built individually.

The main files can be accessed in the folder: web2py > contents > resources > applications
